    <h1>Filet Mignon in Mushroom Wine Sauce</h1>
    <img src="images/Filet-Mignon-mushroom.jpg" alt="Filet Mignon in Mushroom Wine Sauce" />
    <p>This is a very special filet mignon recipe, but it's made in one pan and fairly simple to prepare. This is 
        spectacular for any special occasion! I brought this over to my sister's house and it got eaten fast with rave 
        reviews across the board (despite having to reheat it because by the time I took my pictures, packed it up, 
        drove to my sister's…) it was still mouthwatering!

        I love cooking with wine. Crazy thing is, the bottle of wine that I'm using sells for $7.00 or so at our local 
        grocery store. Wine is an ingredient that has been around for centuries and I love it for cakes, meats, sauces… 
        Cooking with wine adds wonderful depth of flavor to recipes.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                4 Tbsp unsalted butter, divided
            </li>
            <li>
                2 Tbsp olive oil, divided
            </li>
            <li>
                16 oz baby bella mushrooms, thickly sliced
            </li>
            <li>
                1 small or 1/2 medium yellow onion, finely diced
            </li>
            <li>
                4 medium garlic cloves, minced
            </li>
            <li>
                1 Tbsp chopped fresh thyme (or 1 tsp dry thyme if you must)
            </li>
            <li>
                4 (6 oz each) filet mignon steaks (about 1 1/2″ thick)
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 cup Barefoot Merlot *
            </li>
            <li>
                1 1/2 cups low sodium beef broth
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
            </li>
            <li>
                Salt and Pepper to taste
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Place a large heavy-bottomed pan over medium/high heat and melt in 2 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp oil. 
                Add thickly sliced mushrooms and cook 5 min until soft. Stir in onion and cook another 3 minutes. 
                Press in garlic cloves then season with 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper and 1 Tbsp fresh thyme. 
                Cook another 2 min, stirring constantly until garlic is fragrant, then transfer mushroom mixture to a 
                plate. Wipe the skillet clean with a wet paper towel.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pat dry steaks with a paper towel and season all over with salt and pepper (we use a total of 1 tsp salt 
                and 1/4 tsp pepper).
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the same pan over medium/high heat and add 2 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp oil. When butter is hot and 
                finished foaming, add seasoned steaks to skillet and saute, turning over once with tongs about 3-5 min 
                per side for medium-rare (I cooked 5-6 min per side for medium doneness). If steak is browning too fast, 
                reduce heat to medium. Use tongs to transfer steaks to the plate with mushrooms.

            <li>
                Add 1/2 cup Merlot and boil until reduced by half (3 min), scraping the bottom with a spatula to deglaze 
                the pan. Add 1 1/2 cups broth and boil until about 2/3 cup liquid remains (5-6 min). Add 1/2 cup cream 
                and simmer until sauce thickens slighly (2 min). Return mushrooms and steak to the pan and heat until 
                warmed through (1 - 2 min). Season sauce to taste with more salt & pepper if desired (I added about 1/4 
                tsp more salt).
